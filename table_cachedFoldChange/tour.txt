#Welcome;<p>Welcome to the demonstration of the custom <b>cached fold-change table</b> panel!</p><p>The source code for this panel is available <a href="https://github.com/kevinrue/iSEE_custom/tree/master/table_cachedFoldChange">here</a></p>
#customStatTable1;<p>This is the table.</p><p>Right now, it does not display any data because it requires an active selection of samples from another panel to compute a fold-change between the selected samples and all other samples.</p>
#redDimPlot1;<p>In this example, we have linked the custom panel to the <i>Reduced dimensions plot 1</i> panel.</p>
#redDimPlot1;<p><b>Action:</b> Please select any group of cells in this plot.</p>
#customStatTable1;<p>See the custom table being populated with log fold-change values!</p><p>Note how the custom function pre-sorts genes by decreasing fold-change.</p>
#Bye;<p>To be continued...</p>
